# Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository aims to show basic concepts of data analysis, and not only the technical content, but also, a critical view regarding the data.

* Python libraries
	* Numpy
		> NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
	* SciPy
		> SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath. SciPy stands for Scientific Python. It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.
	* Pandas
		> pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
	* StatsModels
		> statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
	* Matplotlib
		> Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
	* Seaborn
		> Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
	* Datetime
		> The datetime module includes functions and classes for doing date and time parsing, formatting, and arithmetic.
	* Threading
		> This module constructs higher-level threading interfaces on top of the lower level _thread module.
	* Speedtest
		> Command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using speedtest.net
	* Faker
		> Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you. Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a production service, Faker is for you.
	* Missingno
	* FuzzyWuzzy
