# Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository aims to show basic concepts of data analysis, and not only the technical content, but also, a critical view regarding the data.

* Python libraries
	* Numpy
		> NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
	* SciPy
		> SciPy is a scientific computation library that uses NumPy underneath. SciPy stands for Scientific Python. It provides more utility functions for optimization, stats and signal processing.
	* Pandas
	* StatsModels
		> statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.
